      <h1>Travelling Light Christian Retreats</h1>
      
      <p>Travelling Light is a Christian Retreat Ministry, which began in 2008.</p>
      <p>We are all on our individual life journey. Some of it we travel alone. Much of it we travel together with others. All of it we travel with God, whether we realise it or not.</p>
      <p>Travelling Light runs retreats and produces reflective material, which we hope will encourage you on your journey. We so often carry 'baggage' from the past, responsibilities and challenges in the present and apprehension about the future. We hope that through the retreats and reflective material, God will draw you closer to himself, and so help you to carry fewer burdens; and that your path in life  might be illuminated by the light of Christ.</p>

      <h2>Why Come on Retreat?</h2>

      <p>A retreat provides an opportunity for you to come away from your everyday environment and spend time with God</p>
      <p>By coming on a retreat, you are dedicating time for God, and for yourself. There are times of 'input' and times together, but otherwise your time is to spend as you wish, drawing closer to God. You may want to reflect on the material provided, to sit in silence inside or outside the church. or to go for a walk. The retreats are not completely silent, but God may get your attention more easily in the quiet, when we are open to fewer distractions.</p>

      <h2>Retreats for 2025</h2>
      
      <p>This year's Main Retreat Theme for 2025 is <strong>Growing Closer to God</strong>.</p>
      <p>The Retreat dates and individual Retreat themes for 2025, are as follows:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Saturday 22 March: Through Creation</li>
        <li>Saturday 10 May: Through Our Senses</li>
        <li>Saturday 5 July: In Challenging Times</li>
        <li>Saturday 27 September: In The Everyday</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All retreats are held between 10am - 4pm at St. Dubricius Church, Whitchurch, HR9 6BZ (near Symonds Yat West). This is 6 miles from Ross-on-Wye and 4 miles from Monmouth. It is also close to the Forest of Dean. The church is situated on the banks of the river Wye in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p>
      <p>There is no fixed charge, but a donation is appreciated.</p>
      <p>There is a car park adjacent to the church with ample parking. Early pre-booking helps us greatly and is advisable as there is a limit on the Retreat places available, particularly if there is a number of you coming together. The retreats are for individuals and small groups. We do limit numbers so that there is sufficient personal space for everyone. Please book by email to <b>travellinglight@supanet.com</b> as early as you can, so we can email you, to confirm your place and send you the Retreat information in plenty of time.</p>

      <p>Drinks are provided but not food, so please bring a packed lunch.</p>
